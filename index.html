				MAIN INFO
			</h3>
			<p>
				Undertale is a 2015 2D role-playing video game created by American indie developer Toby Fox. 
				The player controls a child who has fallen into the Underground: a large, secluded region under the surface of the Earth, separated by a magical barrier.
				The player meets various monsters during the journey back to the surface, although some monsters might engage the player in a fight. 
				The combat system involves the player navigating through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent. 
				They can opt to pacify or subdue monsters in order to spare them instead of killing them. 
				These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on outcomes.

			<h3>
				GAMEPLAY
			</h3>
			<p>
				Undertale is a role-playing game that uses a top-down perspective. In the game, the player controls a child and completes objectives in order to progress through the story. 
				Players explore an underground world filled with towns and caves, and are required to solve numerous puzzles on their journey.
				The underground world is the home of monsters, many of whom challenge the player in combat; players decide whether to kill, flee, or befriend them.
				Choices made by the player radically affect the plot and general progression of the game, with the player's morality acting as the cornerstone for the game's development.

			<h3>
				PLOT
			</h3>
			<p>
				Undertale is set in the Underground, a realm where monsters were banished after war broke out with humans, in the year 201X.
				The Underground is sealed from the surface by a magic barrier with a singular gap at Mount Ebott.
				A human child falls into the Underground from Mount Ebott and encounters Flowey, a sentient flower who teaches the player the game's mechanics and encourages them to raise their "LV", or "LOVE", by gaining "EXP" through killing monsters.
				When Flowey attempts to kill the human, the human is rescued by Toriel, a motherly goat-like monster, who teaches the human how to survive conflict in the Underground without killing.
				She intends to adopt the human, wanting to protect them from Asgore, the king of the Underground.

			<h3>
				DEVELOPMENT
			</h3>
			<p>
				Undertale was developed by Toby Fox across 32 months. Development was financed through a crowdfunding campaign on the website Kickstarter.
				The campaign was launched on June 25, 2013 with a goal of US$5,000; it ended on July 25, 2013, with US$51,124 raised by 2,398 people.
				Undertale's creation ensued after Fox created a battle system using the game creation system GameMaker: Studio.
				He wanted to develop a role-playing game that was different from the traditional design, which he often found "boring to play".
				He set out to develop a game with "interesting characters", and that "utilizes the medium as a storytelling device ... instead of having the story and gameplay abstractions be completely separate".

			<h3>
				UNDERTALE'S FUTURE AND RELATED PROJECTS
			</h3>
			<p>
				Undertale by itself is a finished project and it will be not furthermore updated nor changed.
				But, after previously teasing something Undertale-related a day earlier, Fox released the first chapter of Deltarune on October 31, 2018, for Windows and macOS for free.
				Deltarune is "not the world of Undertale", according to Fox, though characters and settings may bring some of Undertale's world to mind, and is "intended for people who have completed Undertale";
				the name Deltarune is an anagram of Undertale. Fox stated that this release is the first part of a new project, considering it a "survey program" to determine the project's future direction.
				Fox clarified that Deltarune will be a larger project than Undertale, stating it took him a few years to create the game's first chapter, much longer than it took him to complete the Undertale demo.
